# Wayne's World

## Welcome to Wayne's World; it's party time. Excellent!
###### I am an aspiring technical-product guy.
## I am not from a traditional CS background, but that's a good thing!
#### My economics background provide me many of the tools an effective product manager will need.
#### In addition to my experience with analysis and product management, I have spent nearly a year and a half learning how to build full-stack ruby-on-rails and javascript apps. 
##### Welcome to Wayne's World; it's party time!

# Motivation
### This project is a portfolio project which helps to answer the question of what I can do and why you may want to work with me; this is a type of fluid resume which showcases me and my creative sense of humor. 
## I decided to build my own technical blog, instead of going to a blogger or wordpress. I thought this would be a fun and appropriate for me to design my own as a project.
