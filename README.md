## Welcome to Wayne's World; it's party time. Excellent!
###### I am an aspiring technical-product guy.
## I am not from a traditional CS background, but that's a good thing!
#### My economics background provide me many of the tools an effective product manager will need.
#### In addition to my experience with analysis and product management, I have spent nearly a year and a half learning how to build full-stack ruby-on-rails and javascript apps.
