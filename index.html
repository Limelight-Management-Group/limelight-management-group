                Record labels are obsolete. We are here to disrupt them. More and more artist are realizing the power of the digital web age. They understand what we do, artists can be as successful without a label; they can build their own fanbase; they can build their own campaigns; they can book their own shows and plan tours—in turn, venues can book acts that they want to work with and avoid the middle-men who drive up price and waste time; they can release and sell their own music. The music industry is set to be disrupted. The world needs us. We give artists the tools that are relevant to the zeitgeist; the Limelight makes it realistic and financially viable for the aspiring music makers to raise awareness and gain public opinion—far cheaper than it has ever been.
